# Active Learning with Brain-Wide and Region-Specific Graph Measures

This repository contains an extension of the active learning method proposed by Dafflon and colleagues in 2022 [1]. The extension allows the incorporation of brain-wide and region-specific graph measures to create a rich search space for active learning. Additionally, this code integrates Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using the Semopy package [2][3]. SEM enables the prediction of latent variables as outcomes, a common need in the fields of neuropsychology and computational psychiatry.  For more details, please read the accompanying paper [4].
